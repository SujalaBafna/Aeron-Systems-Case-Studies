# ðŸ“š Library Development

## ðŸ”¹ Problem
The companyâ€™s Altium libraries were fragmented:
- Different engineers used **different versions** of components  
- Redundant entries increased **purchasing cost**  
- Lack of consistent **parameters** (RoHS, AEC-Q200, ESD rating, etc.)  

## ðŸ”¹ Solution
I developed a **unified Altium library** by:
1. Creating a standard **nomenclature** and naming format  
2. Defining **parameter templates** for easy BOM extraction  
3. Verifying and correcting **symbols and footprints**  
4. Reviewing **450â€“500 components**, eliminating redundant or low-availability parts  

## âœ… Outcomes
- A streamlined, company-wide **central library**  
- Reduced component duplication in BOMs  
- Simplified purchasing and inventory management  
- Learned how component standards (RoHS, AEC-Q200, etc.) affect industrial design
