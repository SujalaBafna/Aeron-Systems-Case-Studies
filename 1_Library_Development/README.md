# ðŸ“š Library Development

This section documents work on updating and improving Altium component libraries.  
Due to NDA, only **sample library** is provided here to demonstrate structure and standard practices.

- Standardized naming conventions
- Parameter formatting
- Component filtering and selection

**Outcome:** Created a unified Altium library of ~500+ components, improving purchasing efficiency and design consistency.
