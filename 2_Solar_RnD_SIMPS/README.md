# ☀️ Solar R&D – SIMPS Method

## 🔹 Project Goal
Enhance the **SPIM1000 product** to measure solar soiling index directly from in-grid panels and expand functionality to include **IV/PV curves and Pmax**.

## 🔹 My Contributions
- Researched **three different approaches** for system architecture  
- Finalized Capacitance method after evaluation of cost, accuracy, and implementation complexity  
- Compared **SSR vs Mechanical Relays** for panel connection/disconnection  
  - ✅ SSR: Faster, reliable, silent, long life (major factor)  
  - ❌ Relays: Mechanical wear, noise, slower response  
- Built **Multisim simulations** for IV curves and switching  
- Compiled a **BOM** for PoC  

## ✅ Outcomes
- 70% of PoC completed within internship duration  
- Working prototype for panel integration (string modules)  
- Partial IV curve implementation validated in simulation  
- Gained hands-on exposure to **corporate-level project discussions and decision-making**
