# Aeron Systems Case Studies

This repository documents my internship projects at **Aeron Systems**, showcasing work in library development, solar R&D, and accessory product design.  
Each folder represents a distinct case study with technical documentation, simulations, and supporting files.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
1. **Library Development** â€” Embedded libraries for STM32 firmware, focusing on reusability and performance.  
2. **Solar R&D (SIMPS method)** â€” Research and simulations for efficient solar panel power extraction and switching (SSR vs Relays).  
3. **Accessory Product** â€” Design of a supporting accessory board, from problem definition to solution and fabrication.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This repo serves as a **case study portfolio** highlighting:  
- Embedded systems development under real industrial workflows  
- Research-driven decision making (control algorithms, switching technologies)  
- Hardware design and documentation practices
