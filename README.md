# Aeron Systems – Case Studies

This repository presents **selected case studies from my 6-month R&D Hardware Internship at Aeron Systems (IoT Division)**.  
The projects here demonstrate **practical hardware engineering, documentation discipline, and applied R&D skills**.

## 📂 Structure
- **1_Library_Development/** → Standardized Altium library for 500+ components  
- **2_Solar_RnD_SIMPS/** → R&D project on solar monitoring architecture (SIMPS method)  
- **3_Accessory_Product/** → Accessory board design from problem statement to production  
- **docs/** → Supporting technical documents  

---

## 🚀 Highlights
- 📚 **Library Development**: Consolidated and standardized component library, reducing cost and improving consistency.  
- ☀️ **Solar R&D (SIMPS)**: Developed architecture for low-cost solar soiling detection system; simulated IV/PV curves and validated POC.  
- 🔌 **Accessory Product**: Designed, routed, and tested a new PCB accessory within a month, meeting industrial standards.  
- 🛡️ **Compliance Experience**: Assisted in qualifying SPIM1000 product for **CE (IEC61000)** testing at TUV labs.  

These projects highlight my growth in **embedded hardware design, component selection, simulation, compliance testing, and cross-team collaboration**.
