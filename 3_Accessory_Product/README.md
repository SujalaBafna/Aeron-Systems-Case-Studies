# ðŸ”Œ Accessory Product â€“ Sensor to Datalogger Interface

## ðŸ”¹ Problem
Aeronâ€™s dataloggers needed a simple interface to connect arbitrary **sensor outputs** reliably.  
No existing accessory board was available, limiting usability.

## ðŸ”¹ Solution
- Designed schematic in **Altium** within 2â€“3 days  
- Performed PCB routing with **industry-standard pours, vias, stitching**  
- Coordinated with mechanical team for **clearances**  
- Ordered and tested prototype boards  
- Completed all **handover documents** for production  

## âœ… Outcomes
- Fully validated accessory board released within a month  
- Strengthened skills in **PCB routing, mechanical integration, and production documentation**  
- Learned the **product lifecycle**: from concept â†’ design â†’ testing â†’ production handoff
